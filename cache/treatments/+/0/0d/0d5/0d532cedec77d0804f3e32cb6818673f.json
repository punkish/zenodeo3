It is also similar to R. thomasi from Myanmar, Vietnam, Lao PDR, and Thailand, with overlapping call frequencies in some regions. The species has a wide distribution in southern China but is not abundant, with maximum counts reported in caves in Jiangxi province.","images":[{"httpUri":"https://zenodo.org/record/3944523/files/figure.png","captionText":"FIG. 4.

While some studies have reported the presence of R. sinicus in caves, this is likely due to specific circumstances or limited geographic ranges rather than a widespread distribution."},"stored":1750797073931,"ttl":-1}
