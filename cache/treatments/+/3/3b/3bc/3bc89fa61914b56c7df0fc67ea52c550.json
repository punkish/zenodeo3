It is characterized by its distinctive body shape, cuticle features, and reproductive system. The new species differs from most other Gammanema species in males having loop-shaped amphidial fovea instead of unispiral (G. conicauda Gerlach, 1953) or multispiral amphidial fovea (all other species of Gammanema), and females having a multispiral amphidial fovea with a larger size in males and females compared to G. agglutinans.","images":[{"httpUri":"https://zenodo.org/record/15316553/files/figure.png","captionText":"Fig. 6.

The species name refers to its characteristic amphidial fovea shape in males."},"stored":1750797132803,"ttl":-1}
